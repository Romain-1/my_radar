# My Radar

## Subject

In this project, you are asked to render a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic (AT).
The air traffic is a complex system with very strict rules to manage a large number of aircrafts.
For this first version of the simulation, you have to consider 2 types of entity:
- aircrafts,
- control towers.

The basic rules for the my_radar are as follows:
- aircrafts fly from given places to other ones.
- aircrafts appear on the simulation panel when they take off.
- aircrafts disappear from the simulation panel when they land on.
- aircrafts move in a straight line at given constant speeds.
- aircrafts colliding with another one is destroyed and disappear from the simulation panel.
- control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed and they can continue
on their way.
- control towers don’t move and have control areas on the map.
- control towers appear on the simulation panel at launch.


## Requirements

### MUST
- [ ] The program **must** take exactly one parameter.
- [x] The program **must** accept any filepath as argument. It corresponds to the file containing the script for
the simulation containing characters and integers.
- [x] The program **must** displayed an error message if the script is not found or incorrect.
- [x] Your window **must** be 1920x1080 pixels.
- [x] The window **must** be closed using events.
- [x] The program **must** display aircrafts’ hitbox and control towers’ areas.
- [x] The program **must** manage as many displayed entities as possible.
- [x] Aircrafts **must* have 20x20 square shaped hitboxes.
- [x] Aircrafts’ hitbox and sprite **must** be axis-aligned.
- [x] Control towers **must** have circled shaped control areas.

### SHOULD
- [x] The program **should** display and update a timer in seconds at the top-right corner of the window.
- [x] The program **should** stop once all aircrafts have landed on or have been destroyed.
- [x] Aircrafts **should** be able to take off after a given delay.
- [x] Aircrafts and control towers **should** be displayed using sprites.
- [x] The program **should** accept the “-h” option, then display the usage.
- [x] The program **should** be able to switch visibility of hitboxes and areas by pressing the key ‘L’.
- [x] The program **should** be able to switch visibility of entities’ sprites by pressing the key ‘S’.
- [x] Possible user interactions **should** be explicitly displayed in the usage.

### COULD
- [ ] Aircrafts’ hitbox and size **could** be in a 3D space.
- [x] Aircrafts **could** cross any side of a screen and appear on the opposite one.
- [x] Aircrafts’ hitbox and sprite **could** rotate depending on the aircrafts’ direction.
- [ ] Aircrafts’ hitbox **could** follow the sprite boundary.
- [ ] Aircrafts’ hitbox **could** have different sizes.
- [ ] Control towers’ areas **could** cross any side of the screen and affect the opposite one.
- [ ] The program **could** manage floating numbers coming from the script.

### PERSONAL BONUSES
- Use of a quadtree algorithm to check collisions.
- You can display quadtree by pressing the key 'Q'.
- You can add and chose their size by pressing twice the left button of your mouse.
- You can delete towers by pressing right button of your mouse.

## SCRIPT
The script file contains all the information about the simulation and the entities.
Below is a example of a script file. You are free to use any kind of script formatting as long it’s described in a .legend file.

Aircrafts are described by:
- The letter ‘A’, 
- Two integers corresponding to the departure x- and y-coordinates, 
- Two integers corresponding to the arrival x- and y-coordinates, 
- One integer corresponding to the aircraft’s speed (in pixels per second), 
- One integer corresponding to the delay (in seconds) before the aircraft takes off.

Control towers are described by: 
- The letter ‘T’, 
- Two integers corresponding to the control tower x- and y-coordinates, 
- One integer corresponding to the radius of the tower’s control area (in percentage of the greatest side of the screen). 

Entities are separated by a ‘\n’.
The pieces of information are separated by tabs or spaces.

## Installation

If you haven't installed csfml yet, run:

    ./install-csfml.sh
Then run:

    make
And finally:

    ./my_radar <script>
  
*working only on linux*
